## Resource Quota in a cluster

When a cluster is shared by multiple teams, it becomes necessary to limit the amount of resources that can be used by each team. Resource Quota allows you to limit resource usage in the cluster.
- We can create resource quotas per namespace on compute resources such as memory, cpu etc.
- We can also create resource limits based on the number of objects of a certain type created in a namespace.

## Practice
1. Create a resource quota in the dev namespace (cpu: request = 1, limits =2, Memory: request=1Gi, limits=2Gi) an verify.
- Create the namespace dev
```bash
kubectl create ns dev
```
- Create the resource quota using the content in the manifest `01-dev-quota.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: quota-dev
  namespace: dev
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "1"
    requests.memory: 1Gi
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: 2Gi
```
- Apply and verify the object created
```bash
kubectl apply -f 01-dev-quota.yaml
kubectl get quota -A
```
- Create pods in the cluster and verify if the quota applies:

Create the pods using the content in the manifest `02-dev-pods.yaml`. The first two pods will be created but the 3rd pod won't be created due to resource requests and limits

```yaml
# pod 1 in dev namespace
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod1-dev
  namespace: dev
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "800Mi"
        cpu: "1000m"
      requests:
        memory: "600Mi"
        cpu: "350m"
---
# pod 2 in dev namespace
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod2-dev
  namespace: dev
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "300Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
      requests:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "350m"
---
# Pod 3 in the dev namespace. This pod won't be created
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-quota3-dev
  namespace: dev
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "800Mi"
        cpu: "1000m"
      requests:
        memory: "600Mi"
        cpu: "350m"
```
- Apply and verify the object created
```bash
kubectl apply -f 02-pods-quota-dev.yaml
# you will have and error at the creation of pod 3
```

2. Create a resource quota in the test namespace (cpu: request = 1, limits =2, Memory: request=1Gi, limits=2Gi) but also limit the number of pods to 2.

- Create the resource quota using the content in the manifest `03-test-quota.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: quota-test
  namespace: test
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "1"
    requests.cpu: "1"
    requests.memory: 1Gi
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: 2Gi
```
- Apply and verify the object created
```bash
kubectl apply -f 03-test-quota.yaml
kubectl get quota -A
```
- Create pods in the cluster and verify if the quota applies:

Create the pods using the content in the manifest `04-pods-quota-test.yaml`. The first pod will be created but the second pod won't be created due to the number of pods limit.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod1-test
  namespace: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "800Mi"
        cpu: "1000m"
      requests:
        memory: "600Mi"
        cpu: "350m"
---
# this pod won't be created
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod2-test
  namespace: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "300Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
      requests:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "350m"
```
- Apply and verify the object created
```bash
kubectl apply -f 04-pods-quota-test.yaml
# you will get an error at the creation of the second pod
```

- Delete the objects

```bash
kubectl delete -f 01-dev-quota.yaml
kubectl delete -f 02-pods-quota-dev.yaml
kubectl delete -f 03-test-quota.yaml
kubectl delete -f 04-pods-quota-test.yaml
```
